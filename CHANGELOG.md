THE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR RUBY 1.8.7 WILL NOT BE ENSURED IN THE MASTER
AND THE `>= 0.3.0` RELAEASES. We discourage anyone to keep using ruby
1.8.7 for anything. If you're aware of the issues and still willing to
take the risk, we are willing to keep the v0.2.x releases based on the
v0.2.x branch. However, we will not actively develop or backport any
new features to this branch neither will we accept there features that
are not in the master branch.
